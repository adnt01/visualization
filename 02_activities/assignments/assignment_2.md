# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      ```
      Good visualization: https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/examples/5658951917_b8cf0c5b94_b.jpg
      The vis has a good cognitive load on the audience as it is intuitive to understand.
      Easy to read and focus.
      Lack insight: it is complex and there is no clear takeaway or insight.
      Human perception: Audience and viewers perception is reasonable to interpret.
      Aesthetic: the image is visually nice and eye catching.
      Substantive: the use of fries communicates trend but lacks clarity and exact values.
      Perceptual: audience can grasp the idea and inssight, but isn’t very accurate for comparison.
      ```

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      The bars are not straight which creates small errors in values.
      Add legend, the values for y-axis just numers, it will help the audienace to know the metrics for y-axis.
      The title is not complete "FRENCH BY CONSUMPTION BY MONTH". The consumption in a specific city, countru, or the while world!
      ```

      ```
      Bad visualization: https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/examples/oil-flow-daily-lives.jpg
      The vis has a high cognitive load on the audience as not intuitive to understand.
      Many lines — can be hard to read and focus.
      Low contrast: the greyscale makes it hard to see the different pieces of the visualization.
      Lack insight: it is complex and there is no clear takeaway or insight.
      Vis cluttered: too many crossing lines.
      Human perception: not easy and struggles with judging lengths curves, wavy lines distort value comparison. This reduces readability 
      Audience and viewers perception is better at comparing aligned bars on a common axis than curves.
      ```

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      The points below would enahance the vis.
      Use color to group sectors.
      Add percentages to the flows.
      Include a legend
      Aesthetic: Nice and string Sankey visual.
      Substantive: it contains a lot of information about oil
      Perceptual: is high and difficult to grasp and conclude insights.

      Another option is to use a simpler visualization:
      For example use few bar plot; a bar plot for each sector, or by usage or any other grouping.
      Sort the bars to help the viewers to compare.
      The use of few plots will reduce the cognitive load on the audience.
      Will help the audiene to conclude insights
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
